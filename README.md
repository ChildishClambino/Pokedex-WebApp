This is my pokemon api web app!

This app is split into 3 different sections. 

Firstly is the home page.
It offers the ability to navigate to the search page. You can get to there by clicking the "Search Pokemon" button.

That brings us to our second stop on this web app where we can now search for a pokemon using either their name or id.
Name would be the name of the pokemon and the id would refer to the number of 1 through however many pokemon there are. Picking any number assigned to a pokemon would bring up that pokemon.
Once pulled you can also choose to click on "more details" to navigate to the more details page. 

Finally, the details page. This page pulls up extra details on the chosen pokemon.
In all these pages there is a nav bar that allows you to reach the home, and search page, upon clicking on them.
